# 21.print maximum count of 1's chain in array of numbers containing 0 and 1

# ðŸ”¹ Meaning:

# You are given an array (or list) that only contains 0s and 1s.
# You need to find the longest consecutive sequence (chain) of 1s in that array.

# ðŸ“Œ Example 1
# Input:  [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1]


# First chain: 1, 1 â†’ length = 2

# Second chain: 1, 1, 1 â†’ length = 3

# Third chain: 1 â†’ length = 1

# ðŸ‘‰ Maximum = 3

# Output: 3

# ðŸ“Œ Example 2
# Input: [0, 0, 0, 0]


# There are no 1s at all.
# ðŸ‘‰ Maximum chain length = 0

# ðŸ“Œ Example 3
# Input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]


# Only one chain of all 1s.
# ðŸ‘‰ Maximum = 5

# ðŸ“Œ Algorithm (Step by Step)

# Initialize two counters:

# count = 0 â†’ keeps track of current chain of 1s.

# max_count = 0 â†’ stores the maximum chain length seen so far.

# Traverse the array element by element:

# If the element is 1:

# Increase count by 1.

# Update max_count = max(max_count, count).

# If the element is 0:

# Reset count = 0 (because chain breaks).

# After traversal, max_count will hold the answer.
