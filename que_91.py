# Problem
# Initial container:
# Total balls = 100
# Blue balls = 98
# Red balls = 2
# Probability of picking a blue ball:
# p(B) = blue balls / total balls  = 98 / 100 = 0.98
# Question: Add some balls to make new probability = 0.99. How many balls and of which color?


# Step 1: Let’s assume we add only blue balls

# Let the number of additional blue balls = 
# 𝑥
# x

# New total balls = 
# 100
# +
# 𝑥
# 100+x

# New blue balls = 
# 98
# +
# 𝑥
# 98+x

# New probability of picking blue:

# 𝑃
# (
# 𝐵
# )
# =
# 98
# +
# 𝑥
# 100
# +
# 𝑥
# =
# 0.99
# P(B)=
# 100+x
# 98+x
# 	​

# =0.99
# Step 2: Solve for 
# 𝑥
# x
# 98
# +
# 𝑥
# 100
# +
# 𝑥
# =
# 0.99
# 100+x
# 98+x
# 	​

# =0.99

# Multiply both sides:

# 98
# +
# 𝑥
# =
# 0.99
# (
# 100
# +
# 𝑥
# )
# 98+x=0.99(100+x)
# 98
# +
# 𝑥
# =
# 99
# +
# 0.99
# 𝑥
# 98+x=99+0.99x
# 𝑥
# −
# 0.99
# 𝑥
# =
# 99
# −
# 98
# x−0.99x=99−98
# 0.01
# 𝑥
# =
# 1
# 0.01x=1
# 𝑥
# =
# 100
# x=100
# ✅ Step 3: Answer

# Add 100 blue balls

# No red balls need to be added

# After adding:

# Blue balls = 198

# Red balls = 2

# Total = 200

# Probability of blue = 
# 198
# /
# 200
# =
# 0.99
# 198/200=0.99


# answer: add 100 balls  and No red balls need to be added
